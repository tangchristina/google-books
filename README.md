# google-books

Google Books Search is a full-stack React-based application that renders components, works with helper/util functions, and utilizes React lifestyle methods to display queried books to the user. Node, Express, and MongoDB is used to assist with backend CRUD operations so that users can save books to review or purchase at a later time.

# Deployment: 

https://lit-cliffs-37719.herokuapp.com/

# The app consists of two pages:

1.      Search: users can search for books by calling the Google Books API. They will then have the ability to “View” the book on the Google Books website or “Save” the book, which persists in  MongoDB database.

2.      Saved: Renders all saved books from the Mongo database. They will still have the ability to “View” the book on the Google Books website or “Delete” the book, which removes it from the Mongo database and page.
